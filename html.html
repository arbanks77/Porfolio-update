                With over six years of experience as an office assistant for a real estate and home ownership counseling agency, she knows how to keep things organized and attention-grabbing.
                But that's not all.

                Passionate about all things design, Ayanna's creative mind is constantly brewing with fresh ideas.
                Whether it's creating a sizzling new website or whipping up eye-catching graphics for festival promotions and t-shirts, this designer is ready to make her mark.
